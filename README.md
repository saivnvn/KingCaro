### 🧠 AI Strategy Logic

The AI follows a prioritized decision-making process to ensure optimal moves:

1. **If there’s a winning move (five in a row)** → play immediately.  
2. **If the opponent has a four** → block it immediately.  
3. **If the AI can create a four (including a 4×3 threat)** → play it.  
4. **Block the opponent’s open three.**  
5. **Block any opponent’s 4×3 threats.**  
6. **Block any opponent’s 3×3 threats.**  
7. **Otherwise**, use a **Alpha–Beta Search** to find the best move.
